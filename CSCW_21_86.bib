abstract = {Online communication platforms like Slack and Microsoft teams have become increasingly
crucial for a digitized workplace to improve business efficiency and growth. However,
these chat platforms can overwhelm the users with unstructured long streams of back
and forth discussions scattered in various places. Thus, discussions become challenging
to follow, leading to an increased likelihood of missing valuable information. Moreover,
with the unsatisfying keyword-based chat search, users spend a significant amount
of time to read, digest, and recall information from the conversations at the cost
of productivity. In this paper, we present Vertext, an end-to-end AI system that ingests
user conversations and automatically extracts information such as announcements, task
assignments, and conversation summary. Moreover, Vertext gives a unique search experience
to the users by providing search results along with their context, with an improved
performance enabled by semantic search. For the ease of user interaction, all the
information is consolidated on a single dashboard provided by Vertext.},

abstract = {The rise of the Maker movement has led to a growing number of developers who prototype
and program embedded systems. When programming, these developers often rely on support
from various resources-including other developers. However, other developers may not
always be available to provide support in person, and existing technologies for online
help, such as voice chat or Q&amp;A forms, face the fundamental limitation of inspecting
and manipulating developers' circuit boards. As a result, remote helpers can only
provide suggestions or guidance, rather than contributing via physical changes made
to the devices. And only end-user developers have the ability to carry out&nbsp;the planned
tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate WireOn, a programming support research prototype
that allows remote helpers to directly perform tasks on end-user developers' circuit
board by teleoperating a robot arm. The helpers can control the robot arm via a web
user interface to perform simple tasks such as pick-and-place the electronic components,
visually inspect the physical artifacts in real time, and also review the code that
the end-user sent over to them. The new system has the potential to enable more efficient
remote collaboration on embedded system development. (https://youtu.be/uggyxHAlLDQ)},

a process where discussion and summarization are woven together in a single space,
and collaborators can switch back and forth between discussing ideas and summarizing
discussion until it results in a final document that incorporates and references all
discussion points. We implement this process into a tool called Wikum+ that allows
groups working together on a project to create living summaries-artifacts that can
grow as new collaborators, ideas, and feedback arise and shrink as collaborators come
to consensus. We conducted studies where groups of six people each collaboratively
wrote a proposal using Wikum+ and a proposal using a messaging platform along with

abstract = {Over the past decade, civil litigants in the U.S. have come to increasingly rely on
machine learning (ML) systems to classify documents for discovery review and fact-finding,
an approach now broadly referred to as Technology-Assisted Review (TAR). The transformation
of legal discovery from a painstaking manual process to a sophisticated algorithm-driven
methodology took place over a relatively short period of time, many years before controversies
arose surrounding the use of automated risk assessment tools on the criminal side
of the U.S. justice system. Introduced in 2008 to a handful of litigators in an experimental
research setting hosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
TAR was first deployed live on an active litigation in 2012, and by 2015 a vocal and
influential vanguard of judges was actively advocating for its use on cases involving
large, complex document discovery. My research examines the cross-disciplinary experimentation
and collaboration that took place across legal practitioners and computer scientists
leading to ML becoming a judicially accepted solution in U.S. civil litigation practice.
The aim of this research is to develop a comprehensive case study for how an expert
professional field wrestled with the challenges of integrating ML into sensitive decision-making
workflows. While deeply attentive to the unique and complex encounter between U.S.
civil litigation practice and computer science, my work also aims to inform the practice
of algorithmic system design, development, and governance across other high-stakes
professional domains.},

abstract = {Formative experiences in human lives are often unpleasant. Yet social technologies
today are designed to presume positive experiences; 'design for delight' is even a
principle in user interface development. So when humans have negative life experiences
like the loss of a loved one, which often include technology-related tasks, the designs
of their technologies can exacerbate that negativity. It is these negative experiences---interactions
that trigger negative affects related to human sadness or distress---that design and
engineering can and must honor. My dissertation will frame death as a key example
of a difficult life experience that often requires digital interactions and digital
tasks, yet currently lacks adequate tools to facilitate compassionate and meaningful
interactions in a digital context. Incorporating empirical work in human-computer
interaction with roots in cultural anthropology, I propose a project that will examine
the role of ritual in technologically mediated human interactions during times of
grief. Through interviews, participant observation, and tech support, I will create
ritual-based practices around postmortem data that will honor the experiences people
have of the presence of the deceased within that data, while maintaining the necessary
control or closure of accounts that may be preferred.},

are several contributions of my dissertation work. First, it provides insights, lessons,

comprehensive pictures of both individual and group-level behavior, potentially allowing
inferences within and outside the platforms. These digital traces are often in the
form of textual units such as tweets or Reddit posts or comments. Compared to solicited
survey responses, social media posts are the organic, unsolicited thoughts of people
on a variety of topics, and the language in these posts are a key to their attitudes,
beliefs and values. Notwithstanding the many promises of digital traces, recent studies
have begun to discuss the errors that can occur when digital traces are used to learn
about social phenomena. In this thesis, I propose to first, diagnose and characterize
issues in the measurement of people's attitudes at scale, and second, mitigate these
errors through theory-driven solutions. To critically study and record errors and
biases in using digital traces for measuring human behavior, we propose a systematic
framework, named 'Total Error Framework for Digital Traces' (TED). TED is inspired
by and adapted from the Total Survey Error Framework, developed and employed in survey
methodology to assess the validity and reliability of survey-based studies. To mitigate
errors unearthed by examining Computational Social Science through TED, we apply several
domain specific solutions, such as using linguistic theories to understand people's
attitudes. This thesis contributes in improving the reliability and validity of attitude
measurement from digital traces.},

however, it might raise questions about privacy and coercion. There is a dearth in
existing literature to understand users' perceptions of digital medicine. We addressed
this gap in our work. In particular, we conducted semi-structured interview with 15
participants in the USA to gain insights into their perceived benefits and concerns
about using digital pill, preferences to share information with others, and their
preferred modes of learning about the privacy notice before using digital medicine.
This preliminary study shows promise for the CSCW community to conduct further research
on this emerging technology.},

story enactment experience and object-oriented characters. Our system enables users
to enhance parallel interaction in a virtual collaboration environment for storytelling.
They can interactively construct stories and manipulate characters in an intuitive
manner. An initial testing of the system shows a popular adaptation for parents and

between remote working environment and face-to-face setting is the absence of natural
awareness, which promotes social interaction and helps coordination of work flow.
To maintain the benefits of awareness in a remote working environment, it is important
to first understand which information remote workers disclose and need for awareness.
In this paper, we aim to investigate which information is disclosed and needed, and
provide insights to mitigate the difference between the two. We conducted a case study
with an actual workgroup of a university laboratory for a week. They disclosed and
accessed each other's status information while working remotely. Then, a semi-structured
interview asked why certain information was disclosed or accessed. Our results provide
understanding over information sharing between remote workers for awareness in a post-pandemic

it. It has the ability to perform many types of advanced searches that are otherwise
only available on the Quora website, and not through any other existing APIs. The
quoras API is released under an open-source MIT license and available along with the
full API reference on GitHub. The latest stable release is also available on Python

of the platform: 1) set the tone for the conversation, 2) ease the flow of these online
conversations, and 3) improve social presence online. After an initial controlled

of synchronous conversations could be improved with the introduction of this tool,

diving deep into specialised subjects in colleges and universities. To excel in the
current education system, students are required to have a deep understanding of knowledge
according to standardized curriculums and syllabus, and exam-related problem solving
skills. In current school settings, this learning normally occurs in large classes
of 30-40 students per class. Such a "one size fits all'' approach may not be effective,
as different students proceed on their learning in different ways and pace. To address
this problem, we propose the Self-Evolving Adaptive Learning (SEAL) system for personalized

(i) manually annotate each job title with its associated level of seniority, domain
of work and location; and (ii) provide embedding for job titles and discuss various

tweets about others tend to be statistically significantly more positive and uncover
differences in how they tweet about various relationships (family, friends, others)

we discuss how different cultural attitudes may explain these behaviors. We present

we compare less active and more active users in their response to visitor engagement,
finding that more active users are less affected by short-term visitor engagement.

organizations to create and promote compliance- or checklist-oriented toolkits and
frameworks to address values and ethical issues. However, surfacing discussion and
consideration of ethics in broader, more open-ended ways during the design process
may help surface unique needs, social corner cases, or new or different understandings
of values and ethics. This one-day workshop will convene CSCW researchers and practitioners
to propose and consider new interventions and approaches to ethics in design that
go beyond formal checklist- and compliance-oriented approaches. CSCW's rich set of
methods when investigating values and ethics provides a starting point for developing
new approaches and interventions. These may potentially include design activities,
games and roleplaying, critical making, changes to work practice and organizational
structure, or conducting empirical research. Our goal is to explore multiple and alternative
forms of values and ethics interventions, rather than coming to a particular 'best'
approach. This workshop aims to map out a space of interventions for values and ethics,
propose new approaches and interventions, and craft an agenda for experimenting with
and evaluating new interventions.},

of decolonial thinkers, which provides useful theoretical scaffolding on how to start
working towards inclusivity and 'pluriversality'. That is, learning spaces where all
views can co-exist as equally valid, albeit contradicting. Our workshop will be led
by researchers and designers who have both guided and participated in academic and
industry-based CSCW learning spaces across domains like Social Computing, Human-Computer
Interaction (HCI), Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICTD),
Critical Data Studies, and Participatory Design (PD). We invite a broad range of participants

Work (CSCW) research and practice have increasingly explored how to address the multiple
inequities affecting historically marginalized groups. A growing body of CSCW and
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research, building upon education and community development
literature, argues that centering on needs dismisses marginalized users' capacity
for driving change. Needs-based views often lead to designs for the "here and now,''
further marginalizing populations and perpetuating stereotypes. In contrast, an assets-based
approach that puts users' knowledge, strengths, and capacities---textitassets ---at
the core of design can better promote sustained impact. Translating assets into meaningful
designs that interact with intersecting systems of oppression, however, raises critical
questions:What are assets? Whose assets are privileged? What ethical considerations
surface when facilitating assets-based reflections? How can an assets-based design
tackle systems-level problems? In this workshop, we will bring together researchers
and industry actors to explore the implications of assets-based perspectives across
domains, including Education, Information and Communication Technologies and Development
(ICTD), and Participatory Design (PD). Specifically, we will work to develop guidelines
and methodologies for CSCW researchers and designers to identify when and how to pursue
an assets-based approach, navigating issues of power to translate assets into design

civic technology by bridging the gap between researchers and practitioners from different
regions.The workshop will be organized around three central topics: (1) discuss how
the local context and infrastructure affect the design, implementation, adoption,
and maintenance of civic technology; (2) identify key elements of the configuration
of trust among government, citizenry, and local organizations and how these elements
change depending on the sociopolitical context where community engagement takes place;
(3) discover what methods and strategies are best suited for conducting research on
civic technologies in different contexts. These core topics will be covered across
sessions that will initiate in-depth discussions and, thereby, stimulate collaboration
between the CSCW research community and practitioners of civic technologies from both
Global North and South.},
